<summary>[Leetcode] Second highest salary</summary>

_For a similar problem with different approach check Nth highest salary problem_

Write a SQL query to get the second highest salary from the Employee table.

```
| Id | Salary |
|----|--------|
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
```

For example, given the above Employee table, the query should return 200 as the second highest salary. If there is no second highest salary, then the query should return null.

**Answer**

Multiple solutions are possible only one approach is given below for reference

```sql
SELECT
(SELECT DISTINCT(Salary)
FROM Employee
ORDER BY Salary DESC
LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1) 
AS SecondHighestSalary
```

<summary>[Leetcode] Rank Scores</summary>

**Reference -** [**Leetcode**](https://leetcode.com/problems/rank-scores/)

Write a SQL query to rank scores. If there is a tie between two scores, both should have the same ranking. Note that after a tie, the next ranking number should be the next consecutive integer value. In other words, there should be no "holes" between ranks.

```
| Id | Score |
|----|-------|
| 1  | 3.40  |
| 2  | 3.65  |
| 3  | 4.00  |
| 4  | 3.50  |
| 5  | 4.00  |
| 6  | 3.65  |
```

For example, given the above Scores table, your query should generate the following report (order by highest score):

```
| score | Rank    |
|-------|---------|
| 4.00  | 1       |
| 4.00  | 1       |
| 3.95  | 2       |
| 3.65  | 3       |
| 3.65  | 3       |
| 3.40  | 4       |
```

**Answer**

The tie resolving method which is being asked in the question is called Dense Rank, if we use Rank it will have "holes"

```sql
select 
Score, dense_rank() over(order by score desc) as Rank
from Scores
```

<summary>[Leetcode] Consecutive Numbers</summary>

**Reference -** [**Leetcode**](https://leetcode.com/problems/consecutive-numbers/)

Write an SQL query to find all numbers that appear at least three times consecutively.

Return the result table in any order.

Input:

Logs table:

```
| Id | Num |
|----|-----|
| 1  | 1   |

<summary>[INTUIT] Data Analyst Interview Question</summary>

Given the following tables:

&#x20;<img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (18).png" alt="" data-size="original">&#x20;

&#x20;Where

Experiments is a table in which we store whether a user is part of an experiment and if so whether they are in test or control (assume there is only one test variant per experiment).  The fields are:

‚óè     user\_id - There are many users each of whom can be in many experiments

‚óè     assignment\_ts - timestamp of when the user was allocated to the experiment.  A user is only allocated once per experiment.

‚óè     experiment\_id - An experiment has many users

‚óè     experiment\_assignment - Whether the user is in test or control.  Assignments are immutable and there is only one assignment per user/experiment combo.

&#x20;Subscriptions is a table of subscription related events.  For each user, there will always be a trial start event however there will only be a subscription start event if the user subscribes.  Assume a given user can only have one trial start and at most one subscription start.  The subscription can start at any time after the trial start and times for either event type are captured in event\_ts.

**Questions**

Write queries to produce the following:

1. When did each experiment start?  Use the first instance of an experiment assignment to either test or control for an experiment to equate to when the experiment started.  Results should look like:

&#x20;![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (19).png>)

2. How long did each experiment last, expressed in days?  Assume the last instance of an experiment assignment to test or control for an experiment to equate to when the experiment ended.  Results should look like:

&#x20;![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (20).png>)

3. How many users are in test and control for each experiment?  Result should look like:

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (21).png>)

4. What is the conversion rate by experiment assignment for each experiment?  A conversion is any user for whom there is a subscription start event in addition to the trial start event (all users have a trial start event).  If a user is in multiple experiments at the same time, it‚Äôs ok to count them towards the conversion rate of each experiment.  We also want to only return one row per experiment.  Result should look like:

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (22).png>)

5\) For each experiment\_id, rank and list first 3 user\_ids who subscribed to the product. Output should look like:
