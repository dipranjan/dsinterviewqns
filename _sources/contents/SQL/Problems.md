## Problems

If you want to have some hands on practice without the hassle of installing and setting up the required softwares in your local machine [üî´DB Fiddle](https://dbfiddle.uk) provides free SQL sandbox. In a lot of problems below prebuilt sandbox links are already provided to refer but it is always recommended that you setup your personal sandbox to play around.


```{admonition} Problem: [Leetcode] Second Highest Salary
:class: tip, dropdown

**Reference - [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/second-highest-salary/)**

*For a similar problem with different approach check Nth highest salary problem*

Write a SQL query to get the second highest salary from the Employee table.

| Id | Salary |
|----|--------|
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |

For example, given the above Employee table, the query should return 200 as the second highest salary. If there is no second highest salary, then the query should return null.

```

Multiple solutions are possible only one approach is given below for reference

SELECT
(SELECT DISTINCT(Salary)

```{admonition} Problem: [Leetcode] Rank Scores
:class: tip, dropdown

**Reference - [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/rank-scores/)**

Write a SQL query to rank scores. If there is a tie between two scores, both should have the same ranking. Note that after a tie, the next ranking number should be the next consecutive integer value. In other words, there should be no "holes" between ranks.

| Id | Score |
|----|-------|
| 1  | 3.40  |
| 2  | 3.65  |
| 3  | 4.00  |
| 4  | 3.50  |
| 5  | 4.00  |
| 6  | 3.65  |

For example, given the above Scores table, your query should generate the following report (order by highest score):

| score | Rank    |
|-------|---------|
| 4.00  | 1       |
| 4.00  | 1       |
| 3.95  | 2       |
| 3.65  | 3       |
| 3.65  | 3       |
| 3.40  | 4       |

```

````{admonition} Solution:
:class: dropdown

The tie resolving method which is being asked in the question is called Dense Rank, if we use Rank it will have "holes"

```sql
select 
Score, dense_rank() over(order by score desc) as Rank
from Scores
```
