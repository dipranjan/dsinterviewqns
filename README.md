Preparing for interviews is a stressful task. There is an enormous amount of resources available in the internet, multiple repositories, there are even companies that help students prepare for interviews at the Big Tech companies. The idea here is to create an web based accessible version of these resources, optimized across devices so people on this journey can benefit from it no matter where they are from.

This book does not cover the topics in depth, it covers just enough to get you ready for the interview. The assumption here is that the person using it is already familiar with the topic and is here to brush up on the same. Additional resources for someone eager to explore the topic in depth is added. **In short, don't use this as textbook, use it as a revision note.**

This online version of the book **IS AND ALWAYS WILL** be **free** and **a work in progress**. The book gets updated monthly with new sections, more questions and richer content, check the [Log](https://dipranjan.github.io/dsinterviewqns/contents/To%20Do%20List.html) page for the latest updates and keep visiting for new content.
